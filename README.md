# Signal Processing
### Aliasing

In this project we create a series of tones, or pitches, of various frequencies at given sample rate.  We then observe how our specified tones are captured.

We intentionally specify a sample rate that does not cover the bandwidth of interest, to observe the effects of aliasing.

Aliasing is the distortion of a recorded signal that occurs when the sample rate does not sufficiently cover the bandwidth of interest.
